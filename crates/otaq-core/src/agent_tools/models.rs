//! The tools' model lists (AGT-02; d0086, d0088): what each tool itself says it can run, read through its adapter
//! ([`super::AgentTool::list_models`]), and Otaq's copy of it.
//!
//! Only what a tool's list contains can be picked for a named agent (d0086). The copy is kept per tool in the
//! `settings` table (one key per tool, JSON: [`settings_key`]) with when it was read, and refreshed at service
//! start, on `agents.models_refresh` (Settings → Agents opening) and once a day ([`ModelLists::run`]). A failed
//! read keeps the old copy and is logged. Readers ask the in-memory copy, synchronously
//! ([`ModelLists::copy`]): "is `opus` in Claude Code's list, and does it follow the newest?" is
//! `lists.copy(Tool::Claude).and_then(|c| c.list.entry("opus").map(|e| e.kind == ModelKind::Follow))`.
//!
//! Codex and OpenCode have no aliases of their own: their "always the newest" choices are families (d0086). A copy
//! answers them first, one [`ModelKind::Follow`] entry per family that has at least one model in the tool's list,
//! stored `newest:<family>` and resolving to that family's newest model in the list by release date
//! ([`follow_entries`]). They are made each time a copy is asked for, from the tool's list and the current
//! models.dev copy ([`super::catalog`]), so a new list or a new catalog changes them at once.
